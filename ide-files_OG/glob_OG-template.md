# Orchestrator Guide, Title: [Title]


## High Level Objectives

*

## Files to Edit

*   [List files to be created, updated, or deleted. Include path and brief reason.]

## Resources

*   [List relevant web links, documentation files, reference files (include path and line numbers if applicable), etc.]

## Initial State

*   **Assessment:** [Describe the initial state of the project relevant to the task. This should be populated by the Laborer after creating the guide, using appropriate tools to assess the project.]
*   **Relevant Outputs (Optional):** [Include any relevant outputs from initial checks (e.g., lint results, test runs, system info) that inform the Task Sets.]

### Task Set 1: [Descriptive Title for Task Set]

**TS-1 Status:** ⚪

**TS-1 Files to Edit:**

*   [List files involved: `update`/`create`/`delete`]

**TS-1 Resources:**

*   [List reference files, docs, links specific to this TS]

**TS-1 Execution Notes:**

*

**TS-1 Tasks:**

1.  ⚪  |   (e.g. O-Coder, Researcher)  |   [Specific task instruction. Start with a verb.]

2.  ⚪  |   (e.g. O-Coder, Researcher)  |   [Add more tasks as needed]

3.  **TS-1 Validation & End State:**

    ⚪ **Project-Specific Verification:** [Define clear, project-specific steps to verify the Task Set's completion and ensure no regressions. Specify the tools/commands to use (e.g., `npm test`, `python manage.py lint`, `playwright_get_visible_text`, `firebase-emulator-mcp firestore_get_document`).]
       * [Specify expected outcomes, e.g., "Ensure all tests pass", "Verify console has no errors", "Confirm element X is visible", "Check database field Y has value Z".]
    **Relevant Outputs (Optional):** [Space to record outputs from verification steps.]

    ⚪ [Add or remove additional project-specific validation steps as needed. State requirements clearly.]
